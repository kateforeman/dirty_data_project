# Dirty Data Project 

## The brief 

The goal of this project was to take some messy publically available data and wrangle it into a suitable format. Once it was clean and tidy, we had a series of 
data analysis questions to answer. We had the choice of what tasks we chose to do and I decided on task 2 and 4. 

## Folder structure 

The structure of the folders was exactly the same for each task: 

<b>clean_data:</b> this folder holds the clean data saved as a .csv file. 

<b>data_cleaning_scripts:</b> this folder contains the R scripts in which the data cleaning and wrangling took place. 

<b>documentation_and_analysis:</b> the data analysis R notebook answering the data exploration questions stays here. 

<b>raw_data:</b> the raw data is saved in these files as a .csv in task 2 and an .xlsx in task 4.
